I faced same error: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2834](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2834) using Google-Provided Cloud Dataflow Pubsub-to-BigQuery template.
This issue was [fixed](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3864/files) and published included by v2.2.0, but template has not been fixed yet.
